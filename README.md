### 👋
### I am a Senior Frontend Developer with many years experience in the Industry.

It all started with my first computer: As a teenager I created websites for my friends and family in simple HTML. I still do that today, even though the simple HTML has now turned into complex frameworks like Angular and I spend more time with Javascript, SCSS and other serverless frameworks. Different tools, but the same passion! 

Speaking of passion, I love gaming. What do you like?
